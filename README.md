debian-luks-suspend
==================

A script for [Debian][] to lock the encrypted root volume on suspend.

Modified from the original [arch-luks-suspend][] for [Arch Linux][].

Further modified to work on Buster.

When using debian's default full-disk encryption using LUKS, the encryption 
key is kept in memory when suspending the system. This drawback defeats the 
purpose of encryption if you carry around your suspended laptop a lot. One 
can use the `cryptsetup luksSuspend` command to freeze all I/O and flush the 
key from memory, but special care must be taken when applying it to the root 
device.

The `debian-luks-suspend` script replaces the default suspend mechanism of
systemd. It changes root to the initramfs in order to perform the 
`luksSuspend`, actual suspend, and `luksResume` operations.

When successfully completed, it uses loginctl to unlock the user session to
reduce password fatigue.

This script is currently broken under gdm3 with wayland, and sddm with xorg and
gnome, but should be functional under most other circumstances. Please report
any breakage to the [issue tracker][].

This script assumes you're using systemd, and is untested in all but the most 
generic of lvm setups.  It currently breaks under grsecurity, and probably
won't work if you're using lvm+raid. It makes no security guarantees 
whatsoever.  You have been warned.
